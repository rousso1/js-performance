## What this code does?

This fine piece of code calculates nth prime numbers for given indexes.

## How should I work with this code?

You are submitting only contents of the main.js file, so everything that you'll do outside this file won't matter.

In the main.js file you should NOT change:
- name of the class (Primes)
- name of the public method (getPrime)

Your code should work for ALL possible input values (not only for the provided example).

## How HackaTester will test my code?

HackaTester will run your code in the similar fashion it's being used in the index.html file. It will use different indexes though.
