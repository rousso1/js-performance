## What this code does?

This code creates a fish-eye effect on the list of randomly generated users.

## What needs to be improved?

FPS rate for animation. Now it's under 30FPS!

## How should I work with this code?

You are submitting contents of the main.js, everything that you'll do outside this file won't matter.

In the main.js file you should NOT change:
- ID of the DOM element 'people'
- fact that under #people there are 40 child elements

Make sure that output looks exactly the same after your changes!

## How HackaTester will test my code?

HackaTester will measure how fast your code is able to deliver frames when user is scrolling. It will also check if element with ID 'people' has 40 children. It's a simple type of validation.
