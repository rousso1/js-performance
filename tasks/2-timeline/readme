## What this code does?

This code consumes huge JSON file (one in data.js file) and renders nice timeline in the DOM.

## What needs to be improved?

Page loading time - it takes forever!

## How should I work with this code?

You are submitting contents of the main.js and main.css, everything that you'll do outside these two files won't matter.

In the main.js file you should NOT change:
- ID of the DOM element 'timeline_list'
- fact that under #timeline_list there are 1501 children elements

Make sure that output looks exactly the same after your changes!

## How HackaTester will test my code?

HackaTester will measure the time it takes for page to fully render. Then, it will check if element with ID 'timeline_list' has 1501 children. It's a simple type of validation.
