## What this code does?

This code runs a Rambo Lady animation.

## What needs to be improved?

Memory consumption. Current code triggers garbage collection every couple of seconds and is bloating memory.

## How should I work with this code?

You are submitting contents of the main.js, everything that you'll do outside this file won't matter.

In the main.js file you should NOT change names of the existing classes and methods.

Make sure that output looks exactly the same after your changes!

## How HackaTester will test my code?

HackaTester will measure memory consumption of your animation.
